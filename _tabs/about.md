Sometimes I think that I know things. To make sure that I do, I utilize the Feinman Method, as it forces me to understand every little detail of a concept/proof/intuition.

This blog was created to incentivize me to use the Feinmann Method on ideas I find complex or bewildering. That way, I will ultimately have created an archive full of explanations of complex concepts, that I wish were presented to me early on. What a wonderful prospect!

I make my efforts publicly available in the hope that others would find it helpful.
