In this blog, I aim to simplify and clarify intricate concepts in the fields of computer science and mathematics. Essentially, I employ the Feynman method to achieve this goal.

My approach is to break down these concepts into their fundamental aspects and present them from a wider perspective. I make my notes public with the intention of assisting others who might find them useful.
