This blog contains my attempts to explain and clarify complex concepts that I encounter in CS and Math. Essentially it's here that I practice the Feynman method.

I love to distill such concepts to their basic intuitions, and talk about the concepts in a broader perspective. 

I make my notes public in the hope that they would be helpful to other.
