Some video games are truly amazing, particularly [*Action-Adventure*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-adventure_game) games. These games immerse players in thrilling adventures with engaging stories and exciting action. Some outstanding examples of this genre include *Red Dead Redemption*, *The Last of Us*, and *Uncharted*.

This post has to do with last one, [*Uncharted 4*](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end/). This game is an Action-Adventure game about two brothers who pursue a treasure hunt around the globe. In the game you fight the bad guys, climb on stuff, and solve puzzles.

I played this game several times. A few months back, I did a replay of it. Playing the game, I stumbled upon a puzzle that intrigued me. This led me to investigate this puzzle from a formal computational view, and lead to a nice research project, whose main result is that the puzzle is (provably) hard to solve! The research presented several challenges before reaching this result.

This post will outline the process I underwent in this research project. Let the adventure begin!

## Riddles at the Doorstep
***Spoiler alert**: this is the only section that contains spoilers for the game. The spoiler is a minor one and relates to a single puzzle in the game. As I said, this is an insignificant spoiler.*

*You and your brother are on a quest to find the treasure of the infamous pirate Henry Avery in a graveyard. After discovering a secret hatch, you go underground. As you move forward, you finally reach a dead end. However, there's still hope, for the dead end is actually a puzzle...*

*Note: the relevant part is the first 2 minutes.*

What you see is a door, and on the door six ***points***. For the door to open, all of the points must be illuminated. In front of the door there are three ***lighters***. A *lighter* is a machine that shines two light rays onto the door. A lighter can be manipulated in two ways: 1) *translation*, i.e. moving both rays in a particular direction, and 2) *rotation*, in which we rotate the two rays clockwise. 

The goal is to manipulate the lighters, such that all of the points are illuminated. Since there are only 6 points, the puzzle is easily solvable, giving the player a pleasant challenge.

After solving this puzzle, the immediate question that came to my mind was: ***What if there were many points and lighters? Could I solve the puzzle then?***

Then I began researching this puzzle. The first step was to formalize it.

## Formalizing the puzzle
Let's digest the puzzle first. There are 6 points on a wall. We control 3 pairs of light dots on the wall (6 light dots in total). We can move each pair of light dots in some direction (*translation*), which moves both points in the pair; or rotate clockwise (*rotation*). Our goal is to manipulate the pairs of light dots, so each point of the 6 points on the wall is covered by a light dot.

### It's all about the length
Each light dot pair can cover at most 2 wall points. Because the number of light dot pairs (3) is exactly half the number of wall points (6), if we are to cover all 6 points with light dots, each light dot pair must cover **distinct** wall points.

Each pair of light dots has a *length*, which is the distance between its two dots. The two operations we can perform on a pair of light dots preserve the distance between the dots in the pair, i.e. is an ***isometry***. Therefore, in a solution to the puzzle, each pair of light dots should cover two distinct wall points whose distance from one another is exactly the distance between the two light dots.

### A more informative formulation
To clarify, we will restate the problem with geometry: there are 6 points on the plane and 3 lines of different lengths.[^1] We can move a line right, left, up or down, and rotate it. If the end of some line coincides with a point, the point is considered *illuminated*. There's no limitation as to intersections between lines. Can we move the lines such that all of the points are illuminated?

![example-problem-lines](/assets/img/uncharted/example-problem-lines.png){:width="500"}
*Example problem with 6 dots and 3 lines*

![example-line-solution](/assets/img/uncharted/example-line-solution.png){:width="400"}
*The solution*

Clearly, there is a solution if and only if the points could be partitioned into pairs, such that each pair could be covered by a distinct line. This is equivalent to being able to partition the points into pairs, such that the length of each pair is distinct and is the length of some line.

The general problem is this: given $n$ points in the plane, and $n/2$ lines of distinct lengths, find a covering of the points with line ends.

### A first rigorous formulation
Moving forward, we transition from geometry to graphs. In the geometrical formulation, we have $n$ points and $n/2$ lines of distinct lengths.

We create an equivalent graph problem. For each point, we create a node and connect each pair of nodes with an edge whose weight is the distance between the respective points on the plane. The resulting weighted graph is a clique.


![weighted-clique](/assets/img/uncharted/weighted-clique.png){:width="500"}
*The weighted graph for the example problem. Partial edge weights are given*

Then we convert the lines to a *target weights* set, which is a set that contains the lengths of all of the lines. These, as we recall, are distinct lengths. Then, the problem is this: *find a perfect matching of the graph, such that the weights in the matching are exactly the target weights.*

The respective decision problem is this:

> (***Target Weights Perfect Matching Problem***) Given a weighted graph $G=(V,E,w)$, and a set of target weights $T\subset \mathbb{R}$ of cardinality 
> $$|V|/2$$
> , can $G$ be perfectly matched by a matching $M\subseteq E$ such that $w(M)=T$?

Such a matching is called a ***proper matching***.
We note that like many other problems, given an oracle to the decision problem, one can find a solution to the original problem of *finding* a proper matching with a polynomial number of queries + polynomial time computation. This makes the two problems polynomially equivalent.

As the decision problem is simpler, that's the one we'll analyze.
### Simplifying the problem
Now that we have the first formalized decision problem version of the puzzle, let's simplify it.
#### Removing superfluous edges
Let $e\in E$ be an edge in the graph. If the weight of the edge isn't a target weight (i.e. $w(e)\notin T$), the edge can't be used in a proper matching. Therefore, we can remove it, without changing the answer to the question of whether the graph admits a proper matching.

Repeating that for all edges of non-target weight, we're left with a graph $G'=(V,E')$ such that $w(E')\subseteq T$. So in our problem, we can assume that the weighting function $w$ maps edges only to target weights, i.e. that $w:E\rightarrow T$.

#### Getting rid of the target weights 
Because $$|T|=|V|/2$$ , a proper matching of the graph $M\subseteq E$ must have representatives of all target weights. That is, for a target weight $t\in T$, there is at least one edge in the proper matching $e\in M$ such that $w(e)=t$. Because 
$$ |T| = |V| / 2 $$
, and a perfect matching contains that many edges, there must be *exactly* one representative of each target weight in a proper matching. This also means that for a proper matching to exist, we must have $T\subseteq w(E)$, and in turn $T=w(E)$.

This gives rise to the following problem:

> ***(All Weights Perfect Matching)*** Let $G=(V,E,w)$ be a weighted graph. A perfect matching $M\subseteq E$ of $G$ is said to be an *all weights perfect matching* if it has a representative for every weight in the graph. That is, for every weight in the graph $l\in w(E)$, there is at least one edge in the matching $e\in M$ that has it as weight, i.e. $w(e)=l$.

> ***(All Weights Perfect Matching Problem)*** Given a weighted graph $G=(V,E,w)$,  does it admit an all weights perfect matching?

*Note: The problem is not equivalent to the previous one. It would if we demand that 
$$|w(E)|=|V|/2$$
. I chose to discard this condition, as it leads to a more elegant problem and analysis.*

Now this is a much simpler problem! I couldn't find any reference to such a problem, or a similar one. So I took the honour to name it, and to call it by a more computer-scienteesh abbreviation: ***The AWPM Problem***.


### Playing with the problem
Before analyzing its complexity, let's play with the AWPM problem a bit.

*In which case can we easily determine that no all weights perfect matching exists?* If the number of weights in the graph ($ | w(E) | $) is more than 
$$ |V| / 2 $$
, obviously, there isn't such matching.

 *When is the problem easy?* We can talk about two factors: the number of representatives of weights, and the number of weights in the graph.
 1. If some weight in the graph has only one representative edge, this edge must be part of the matching. We can add it to the matching, remove the vertices it matches, and continue as such. So **if every weight in the graph appears exactly once**, we can easily solve the problem. 
 2. **The number of different weights in the graph is small**. Indeed, if the number of weights is constant, say 
 $$|w(E)|=c$$
  , then we could simply choose disjoint representatives for each of the $c$ weights, remove the representatives as well as their vertices from the graph, and do non-weighted perfect matching on the resulting graph. Because the number of representatives for each weight is at most $|E|$, the number of choices for representatives for all weights is at most $|E|^c$ i.e. polynomial in the number of edges. For each selection, we do polynomial work.
 
*What's a trivial algorithm for the problem?* For each distinct weight in the graph $l\in w(E)$, choose one representative edge in the graph, such that the chosen representatives are disjoint. Remove the chosen representatives as well as their vertices. Run a perfect matching algorithm on the graph as a non-weighted graph. This is an exponential time algorithm, for the number of choices is at worst exponential in the number of weights in the graph.

Then I thought: could I do better? I searched for a better algorithm. Failing to find one, I turned in the opposite direction: proving that the AWPM problem is hard.

## Proving the hardness of the puzzle
Taking the direction of hardness proof, we wish to find a suitable notion of hardness. Surely, AWPM is in NP, so a natural hardness criterion is NP-hardness.

The easiest route to proving AWPM is NP-hard is by reducing an NP-complete problem to AWPM. This involves "simulating" the structure from the NP-complete problem with some structure in the AWPM problem.

The easiest structure is 3SAT-like languages. In these problems, we need to simulate variables and clauses. Given a formula, we wish to create for each variable a ***variable gadget*** that simulates it, and for every clause, we wish to create a ***clause gadget*** that simulates it. The gadgets are weighted graphs. The variable gadget simulates assigning a truth value to the variable, whereas the clause gadget is somehow connected to the respective variable gadgets to simulate the induced truth value of the clause. We wish for the resulting weighted graph to admit an all weights perfect matching *if and only if* the source formula is satisfiable.

We will try reducing [3SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem#3-satisfiability) to AWPM. Let $\psi = C_1\wedge ...\wedge C_k$ be a 3SAT instance with variables $x_1,...,x_n$, i.e. each clause is of the form $C_i=(y_{i1}\vee y_{i2}\vee y_{i3})$ and each literal $y_{ij}$ is either some variable of a negation of one. We will craft a weighted graph, that admits an all weights perfect matching if and only if $\psi$ is satisfiable.

*Note for ahead: when giving a graph, all of the nodes are distinct, even if their labels are the same.*

### Variable gadget
We create a variable gadget for each variable $x_i$ - a weighted graph that simulates a truth value assignment to $x_i$. The gadget looks like this:

![iso_graphs](/assets/img/uncharted/variable-gadget.png){:width="550"}
 *The variable gadget for $x_i$*


 The variable gadget is made up of two parts: the value ***assignment section*** and the value ***distribution section***.

The assignment section is a loop, made up of an ***indicator node*** (the one labelled $x_i$), which is connected to two ***selector nodes***, one for each truth value: ***TRUE selector*** (labelled $T$) and ***FALSE selector*** (labelled $F$). Then a node that closes the loop. All of the edges in the assignment section have arbitrarily distinct weights. Given a perfect matching of the assignment section, the choice of which node is paired with the indicator node indicates the truth value set for $x_i$, hence the name "indicator node".

The distribution section is made up of pairs of connected ***value nodes***, labelled with truth values - ***positive*** and ***negative*** value nodes. There's a pair for each edge weight that appears in the assignment section.

Trying to find an all weights perfect matching of the variable gadget reveals its inner-workings. Such a matching is in particular a perfect matching. There are only two options for perfectly matching the assignment section:

![iso_graphs](/assets/img/uncharted/possible-matchings-assignment.png){:width="550"}
*The two possible **perfect matchings** of the assignment section*

In the case that we match the indicator node to a TRUE selector node (the left matching in the figure), all of the negative value nodes must be matched between themselves. That's because their weights are absent from the matching of the assignment section, and we look for an *all weights* perfect matching. The case is similar to when we match the indicator node to a FALSE selector node. What about the other value nodes, those that aren't forcefully matched? These could be matched between themselves, or matched to new nodes that we will create and link them to, which we do later.

For example, when matching the indicator to a TRUE selector, all of the black edges must be included in the matching, while the blue ones are optionally included:

![awpf_var_gadget](/assets/img/uncharted/awpf-variable-gadget.png){:width="550"}
*One of two possible (partial) all weights perfect matchings of the variable gadget. Black edges are in the matching, blue edges could be included but don't have to. The nodes they connect could instead be matched to nodes we create later.*

We've shown that we can create a variable gadget with 4 positive value nodes and 4 negative value nodes. We can similarly create variable gadgets that contain $2k$ positive value nodes and $2k$ negative value nodes for $2k\ge 4$, by making the assignment section a loop of length $2k$, and add corresponding value node pairs.

Let $N_{x_i}$ and $N_{\neg x_i}$ be the number of times $x_i$ and $\neg x_i$ appear in $\psi$ respectively. For instance, in $\psi=(x_1\vee x_2\vee x_3)\wedge (x_1\vee \neg x_1\vee x_2)$ we have $N_{x_1}=2$ and $N_{\neg x_1}=1$. Note that we can assume that both $N_{x_i}$ and $N_{\neg x_i}$ are even, as we can set $\psi'=\psi\wedge \psi$ and continue with $\psi'$ instead. 

For a variable $x_i$, its variable gadget will have $\max ( N_{x_i},N_{\neg x_i} )$ positive and negative value nodes.

For example, if $N_{x_i}=6$ and $N_{\neg x_i}=4$, then we want 6 value nodes per truth value, and the variable gadget of $x_i$ is the following:

![big_var_gadget](/assets/img/uncharted/big-var-gadget.png)
*Variable gadget that distributes 6 value nodes for each truth value. The assignment section is a loop of length 6.*

What we said before works here as well: in an all weights perfect matching for the gadget, the choice of who to pair with the indicator node dictates which value nodes are forcefully matched.

![big_var_gadget_match](/assets/img/uncharted/big-var-gad-matching.png)
*When matching the indicator to the FALSE selector, the positive value nodes are forcefully matched to include their weights, whereas the negative value nodes are optionally matched.*

To summarize the variable gadget: depending on the truth value set for $x_i$ as indicated by the perfect matching of the assignment section ("which selector have we matched to the indicator node?"), we have certain nodes forcefully matched (value nodes of the opposite truth value), while the value nodes of the same truth value are not forcefully matched. These could either be matched between themselves or with new nodes that we are about to create and link them to.

### Clause gadget
The clause gadget isn't standalone and is connected to variable gadgets. Let's start with an example, the clause gadget for the clause $x_1\vee \neg x_2 \vee x_1$:

![example-clause-gadget](/assets/img/uncharted/example-clause-gadget.png){:width="500"}
*The clause gadget for the clause $x_1\vee \neg x_2\vee x_1$. The weight of the unweighted edges is $\Gamma$. The nodes above the dotted line are the clause gadget nodes while those below are nodes of respective variable gadgets.*

Each clause gadget introduces 5 new nodes and two distinct edge weights we denote $\Delta$ and $\Gamma$.

To simulate a clause using a graph in the all weights perfect matching setting, we start with three distinct ***literal nodes*** - one for each literal in the clause. We label them with the respective literals. Each literal node is connected to a value node from the respective variable gadget with an edge. These three edges have the same weight $\Delta$, which is distinct from all other weights in the graph.

We can do that because we have enough value nodes to address all literals in the formula by construction, so each literal node is connected to its own distinct value node. Hence in our example, the two $T_{x_1}$ nodes are *distinct* positive value nodes from the variable gadget of $x_1$.

Apart from the literal nodes, we have two additional ***completer nodes***, which are connected with an edge and connected to the three literal nodes. All of these edges have the same weight $\Gamma$, which is distinct from all of the other weights in the graph.

The general construction, for a clause $y_1\vee y_2\vee y_3$, is shown in the figure below.
![general-clause-gadget](/assets/img/uncharted/general-clause-gadget.png){:width="500"}
*Clause gadget for clause $y_1\vee y_2\vee y_3$. $val(y_i)$ denotes some value node corresponding to the literal $y_i$, that is if $y_i=x_j$ then $val(y_i)=T_{x_j}$ and if $y_i=\neg x_j$ then $val(y_i)=F_{x_j}$.*

### The full view
Let's make an intermediary summary: we have variable gadgets for each variable and clause gadgets for each clause, which are linked in a specific fashion. Let's see the reduction graph for the formula $\psi=(x_1\vee x_2\vee x_1)\wedge (\neg x_1\vee x_2\vee \neg x_1)$.

![example-full-reduction](/assets/img/uncharted/example-full-reduction.png)
*The reduction graph for the formula $\psi=(x_1\vee x_2\vee x_1)\wedge (\neg x_1\vee x_2\vee \neg x_1)$*

In green and yellow we see the variable gadgets for $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively. In purple and orange we see the clause gadgets for the respective clauses from the formula. We note that not all value nodes have a literal node as a neighbour and that each value node could have at most two neighbours - one value node and optionally a literal node.

We also note that we distributed the truth value nodes across the clauses, such that all of the undistributed value nodes could be matched between themselves. For example, look at the lowest pair of green nodes.

Let's summarize the whole structure of the reduction graph. It may be helpful to peek at the example above as you read this.

Each variable gadget is composed of:
1. *Assignment section* - a loop that simulates the selection of a truth value. The node matched to the indicator node indicates the selected truth value.
2. *Distribution section* - made up of nodes that distribute the value selected in the assignment section. Made up of positive and negative value nodes. The value nodes of the opposite truth value of the selected value must be matched between themselves in an AWPM, whereas the value nodes of the selected truth value can either be matched between themselves or with literal nodes in clause gadgets, if available.

Each clause gadget is composed of:
1. Three literal nodes, each connected to a value node from the respective variable gadget. These edges have all the same weight, distinct from all others.
2. Two completer nodes, connected with an edge, and each connected to all three literal nodes. All edges incident to completer nodes have the same weight, distinct from all others.

Let's see who are the neighbours of each node in the graph, so we can see what pairing options there are in a perfect matching:
1. *Variable gadget*
	1. *Assignment section node* - has two neighbours, both from the same assignment section.
	2. *Distribution section node* - has either one or two neighbors. Has a value node neighbour of the same value from this section, and potentially a neighbour that's a literal node in a clause gadget.
2. *Clause gadget*
	1. *Literal node* - 3 neighbours: two completer nodes and one value node from a variable gadget.
	2. *Completer node* - 4 neighbours: three literal nodes and the other completer node.

The only nodes with varying amounts of neighbors are the value nodes.

Because $N_{x_i}$ is even, only an even number of the positive value nodes of $x_i$ are consumed (i.e. have a literal node neighbour). Because we start with an even number of positive value nodes, there's an even number of unconsumed positive value nodes. These are couples of positive value nodes, that is, they can be matched between themselves.

Now we go on to show the correctness of the reduction. This includes two directions:
1. If $\psi$ is satisfiable, then the reduction graph admits an all weights perfect matching.
2. If the reduction graph admits an all weights perfect matching, then $\psi$ is satisfiable.

We begin with the first direction.

### If $\psi$ is satisfiable, then $G$ admits an AWPM... almost
Assuming that $\psi$ is satisfiable, we try to build an all weights perfect matching for the reduction graph $G$. We look at the assignment of truth values of the variables that satisfies $\psi$.

Let's try to match all of the nodes, with all of the weights that appear in $G$:
1. Variable gadget for $x_i$
	1. *Assignment section* - match according to the truth value of $x_i$. That is, if $x_i=T$ match the indicator node with the TRUE selector, and if $x_i=F$ match it with the FALSE selector. Then continue matching the loop, there's only one way to do it. This perfectly matches the section.
	2. *Distribution section*
		1. *Opposite truth value node* - match all pairs of value nodes of the opposite truth value. Now we covered all of the weight values that are present in the assignment section. 
		2. *Same truth value node* -
			1. If the node is a neighbour of a literal node, match it with it.
			2. Otherwise, match the node with its value node neighbour, which also doesn't have a literal node neighbour.
2. Clause gadget for $y_1\vee y_2\vee y_3$
	1. Because the assignment satisfies $\psi$, assume WLOG that $y_1$ is true under the satisfying assignment. By construction, $y_1$ is connected to a respective value node, which already is matched to $y_1$ in step 1.2.1. 
		1. In the case that both of the other two literal nodes aren't matched already, we match the literal node of $y_2$ with the 1st completer node, and $y_3$s literal node with the 2nd completer node. 
		2. In the case that both of the other two literals are matched already, we match the two completer nodes.
		3. In the case that exactly one is already matched, we match the remaining literal node to the 1st completer node. This leaves the 2nd completer node the only node unmatched.
		
		In all three cases, we covered all of the edge weights present in the clause gadget.

Let's see that in action on our example $\psi=(x_1\vee x_2\vee x_1)\wedge (\neg x_1\vee x_2\vee \neg x_1)$, with the satisfying assignment $x_1=F,x_2=T$:

![example-full-reduction-with-matching](/assets/img/uncharted/full-reduction-full-matching.png)
*Reduction graph for the formula $\psi=(x_1\vee x_2\vee x_1)\wedge (\neg x_1\vee x_2\vee \neg x_1)$ and the satisfying assignment $x_1=F,x_2=T$*

Here we didn't face the problem of an unmatched second completer node. But we could've if some clause had exactly two true literals under the satisfying assignment.

The procedure described above produces an all weights matching, but not necessarily a *perfect* matching. This *almost* works - if we could only allow the option not to match the 2nd completer node...

Let's change the AWPM problem a bit, and see where we can get.

> (***Targeted All Weights Matching***) Let $G=(V,E,w)$ be a weighted graph and $T\subseteq V$ a ***target node set***. Is there an all weights matching $M\subseteq E$ such that every node in $T$ is incident to an edge in $M$?

Or in other words: is there an all weights matching that matches all of the nodes in $T$? That is, every target node is either matched with another target node, or with a nontarget node, and all of the weights are present.

This is a different problem but don't worry, we address the change later.
So our reduction will be to TAWM instead of AWPM. In it, $T$ will contain $|V|-k$ nodes, which is the set of all nodes except second completer nodes. (Recall that $k$ is the number of clauses in $\psi$.)

Now it works! We can always produce a targeted all weights matching for a satisfiable formula's reduction graph. The TAWM instance for our example is depicted below, where the target nodes which must be matched are coloured black, and nontarget nodes are coloured brown:

![example-full-reduction-with-matching](/assets/img/uncharted/TAWM-example.png)
*The reduced TAWM instance for $\psi=(x_1\vee x_2\vee x_1)\wedge (\neg x_1\vee x_2\vee \neg x_1)$. The target node set $T$ contains the black nodes.*

Our first attempt made us alter the problem. So instead, we show that TAWM is NP-complete, and later we show that AWPM is also hard. We've already shown the first direction of the proof for TAWM, now we show the second.

### If $G$ admits a TAWM, then $\psi$ is satisfiable
Assume $G$ admits some targeted all weights matching for its reduced TAWM instance, with the target nodes being all nodes except 2nd completer nodes. We craft an assignment to the variables of $\psi$ that satisfies it.

We consider an arbitrary targeted all weights matching that $G$ admits, if there's more than one.

For each variable $x_i$, we set its value to be TRUE or FALSE, corresponding to which selector node the indicator node in its variable gadget is paired with in the matching that $G$ admits.

Let $C=y_1\vee y_2\vee y_3$ be a clause in $\psi$, and we show that it's satisfied by the assignment. We look at the clause gadget of $C$. Because the matching is in particular an all weights matching, and there are only three edges in $G$ whose weight is the weight of the literal-to-value node edges between the gadget and value nodes, the matching must include at least one such edge. Assume WLOG that this edge is the one connecting $y_1$ to its value node $v$. We have two cases:
1. $y_1=x_j$. In this case, the indicator node in $x_j$s variable gadget must've been paired with the TRUE selector node, for otherwise, the value node $v$ must've been paired with a fellow positive value node, to include their edge's weight. Hence, in our truth value assignment, we set $x_j=T$, and $C$ is satisfied.
2. $y_1=\neg x_j$. This case is similar: the literal node of $y_1$ is paired with a negative value node in $x_j$s variable gadget, forcing its indicator node to be paired with the FALSE selector node, which means that in our assignment we have set $x_j=F$, and hence $y_1=T$, and the clause $C$ is satisfied.

Wonderful. TAWM is NP-complete!
### What about AWPM?
We've shown that a variant of AWPM - TAWM - is NP-complete. One could show that AWPM is NP-complete by altering the reduction from 3SAT to TAWM a bit, but the reduction I found is a bit ugly.[^2]

Instead, we seek another notion of hardness that results in a more elegant discovery, that sheds some light on the relationship between AWPM and TAWM. 

We show that AWPM can't be solved in polynomial time, i.e. that AWPM isn't in P, unless P=NP. We do it by proving that given a polynomial time oracle to AWPM, one can solve TAWM in polynomial time.

So let's assume that we can solve AWPM instances in polynomial time. Let $\langle G=(V,E,w),T\rangle$ be a TAWM instance with target node set $T\subseteq V$.

Firstly, if $T=V$, the problem becomes an all weights *perfect* matching. That we can solve that in polynomial time, hooray.

Let's look at the case that $|T|=|V|-1$, i.e. there's exactly one nontarget node $u$. If the instance admits a targeted all weights matching, it either includes $u$ or not. If it does, then it's an all weights *perfect* matching, which we can find in polynomial time. Otherwise, the matching doesn't include $u$. What we do is change the graph $G$ to produce a new graph $G'$ as such:
1. Add a new node $A$
2. Select an arbitrary weight that doesn't exist in $G$, denoted $\alpha\notin w(E)$
3. Connect $A$ and $u$, with an edge of weight $\alpha$

If $u$ isn't included in the targeted matching in $G$, it could be matched in the new graph $G'$ with $A$, and the new matching is an all weights perfect matching of $G'$.

Of course, if we find an all weights perfect matching in $G'$, every target node is either matched with another target node or with a nontarget node, but **not** with the new node $A$, by construction. Removing the edge between $A$ and $u$, we are left with a targeted all weights matching.

So we can solve for the case 
$$ |T|=|V|-1 $$
as such: solve the AWPM for $G$ and for $G'$, and if any returns true, return true, and otherwise false.

More generally, we have $|T|=|V|-l$, which we solve as such:
1. For $i=0,1,...,l$, do
	1. Let $\alpha_1,...,\alpha_i\notin w(E)$ be $i$ arbitrary weights not present in $G$
	2. Create a graph $G'$ from $G$ by adding $i$ new nodes $A_1,...,A_i$
	3. Connect each new node $A_j$ to all nontarget nodes ($V\setminus T$) with edges of weight $\alpha_j$
	4. Solve AWPM on $G'$ in polynomial time. If returns true, return true
2. Return false

If we find an AWPM in any $G'$, it contains a targeted all weights matching in $G$. We get it by removing the edges from the matching that are new edges (i.e. those incident to some $A_j$). Because each target node in $G'$ is connected to either a target node or a nontarget node, in the all weights perfect matching of $G'$, it will be matched with a node in $V$. This means our matching is a *targeted* matching. It's also *all weights* because the removed edges have only weights not in $G$, and only the removed edges have such weights.

On the other hand, if $G$ admits a targeted all weights matching for $T$, we can make it a perfect one in $G'$ by matching the superfluous nontarget nodes to the new nodes in the corresponding $G'$. (Which is the one for $i$=number of unmatched nontarget nodes in the matching that $G$ admits for $T$.)

As an example, take the following graph $G$, where target nodes are black and nontarget nodes are blue:


![TAWM-to-AWPM-graph](/assets/img/uncharted/TAWM-to-AWPM-graph.png){:width="400"}
*Instance of TAWM with two nontarget nodes (in blue), and two weights $a$ and $b$*


In this graph, there are two nontarget nodes. This graph has a targeted all weights matching: 

![TAWM-of-graph](/assets/img/uncharted/TAWM-of-graph.png){:width="400"}
*A matching that matches all target nodes (black), and contains all weights ($a$ and $b$) ; doesn't match any nontarget nodes (blue)*


But it doesn't have a *perfect* one. Then, in the iteration $i=2$, we have the following $G'$, with two auxiliary nodes:

![TAWM-to-AWPM-GTag](/assets/img/uncharted/TAWM-to-AWPM-GTag.png){:width="450"}
*The graph $G'$ for the iteration $i=2$ - nontarget nodes are blue, and the two auxiliary nodes are brown*


Which completes the partial matching as such:

![awpf-of-gtag](/assets/img/uncharted/awpf-of-gtag.png){:width="400"}
*An all weights perfect matching for $G'$ in the iteration $i=2$*


### Intuition is tricky
Coming with the last reduction contradicted my intuition. After all, why would we be able to solve a *targeted* matching using a *perfect* matching oracle? The trivial way would be to guess which of the nontarget nodes isn't included, remove it, and then (all-weights-) perfectly match the resulting graph. This takes exponential time...

So this intuition is wrong. But I had another intuition regarding the hardness of AWPM which started this project, and turned out to be correct. 

Each weight in the graph must appear at least once in the matching. Given a weight, we need to choose some edge representative that will be in the matching, but if there's more than one, which will we choose? Is there any structure that we could exploit so we don't need to try all of them?

Let's formalize this. For each weight $c\in w(E)$, we have a set of edges $W_c\subseteq E$ of all the edges with weight $c$. So, we must choose at least one edge from each $W_c$. Note that these sets of edges partition $E$, meaning $$E=\cup _{c\in w(E)}W_c$$ and $W_c\cap W_{c'}=\emptyset$.

Moreover, the chosen edges must be *disjoint*, for the selection to be a matching. Additionally, looking at edges as a set of cardinality 2, the union of the selected edges must be $V$, for the selection to be a *perfect* matching.

This resembles very much the ***Exact Cover*** problem, which is NP-complete.

> (***Exact Cover***) Given a collection $S$ of subsets of a set $X$, an exact cover is a subcollection $S'\subseteq S$ such that each element in $X$ is contained in *exactly one* subset in $S'$.
> 
> (***Exact Cover Problem***) Given a set $X$ and a collection $S$ of subsets of $X$, is there an exact cover of $X$ w.r.t. $S$?

The AWPM problem for $G=(V,E,w)$, stated as something similar to an exact cover problem, is the following:
> (***AWPM as a variant of Exact Cover Problem***) Is there a collection of edges $S'$, such that every node in $V$ appears in exactly one edge, and that $S'\cap W_c\ne \emptyset$ for all $c\in w(E)$?

The general form of this variant is

> (***Exact Cover with Representatives Problem***) Given a set $X$ and collections of subsets $S,T_1,...,T_k$ of $X$, is there a subcollection $S'$ of $S$ such that each element of $X$ is contained in exactly one subset in $S'$, and that $S'\cap T_i\ne \emptyset$ for all $i$?

Meaning, $S'$ contains at least one subset ("representative") from each $T_i$. As a generalization of the exact cover problem, the exact cover problem with representatives is NP-complete (try setting $k=0$, or more meaningfully $k=1,T_1=S$).

This doesn't prove the hardness of the AWPM variant, in which the subsets in the collections $S,T_1,...,T_k$ have cardinality 2. That being said, it tells a bit about the computational nature of AWPM.

## Summary
Sadly, our adventure has come to an end. We've shown that a puzzle from Uncharted 4 is computationally hard, assuming P!=NP.

This result yields a few amusing consequences:
1. **A good Uncharted 4 player doesn't exist!** Well, at least if the puzzle was bigger.
2. **A good Uncharted 4 player is a good 3SAT solver!** Simply reduce the formula to an Uncharted 4 puzzle, and let the player solve it. Oh, but do clarify that the puzzle could be impossible, for otherwise...

So this post adds Uncharted 4 to the numerous list of computationally hard games, like *Tetris*, *Super Mario Brothers*, *Donkey Kong*, and more.

It also meddled with a novel type of problem: matchings on **weighted** graphs.[^3] This post also introduced a new problem (as far as I could tell), *All Weights Perfect Matching*, and proved its hardness.

Did the game developers know that they introduced a novel problem in their game, let alone that it was computationally hard? I don't know :) I'll update this post once I receive their answer.

In the meantime, do check out Uncharted 4. It's incredible ⭐️

[^1]: In the original puzzle, the lengths of the lighters are distinct as well. That being said, the problem where the lengths of the lighters could repeat is at least as hard as the distinct lengths variant.

[^2]: For the intrigued reader: work on $\psi'=\psi\wedge \psi$, and alter the reduction from 3SAT to TAWM by adding two new nodes connected with an edge with new weight $\lambda$. Because in $\psi'$ every clause has an identical twin clause, we have identical twin clause gadgets. For each twin clause gadgets, connect their 2nd completer nodes with an edge of weight $\lambda$. I'll let you figure out why this works by yourself.

[^3]: All of the hard problems I found were on unweighted graphs. For example, see the *Minimum Maximal Matching* problem.
