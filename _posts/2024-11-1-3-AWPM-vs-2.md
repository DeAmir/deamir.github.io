The [previous post](https://deamir.github.io/posts/uncharted-4/) discussed the *AWPM* problem, which I discovered while playing Uncharted 4, a video game. The problem is as follows:

> ***(All Weights Perfect Matching)*** Let $G=(V,E,w)$ be a weighted graph. A perfect matching $M\subseteq E$ of $G$ is said to be an *all weights perfect matching* if it has a representative for every weight in the graph. That is, for every weight in the graph $l\in w(E)$, there is at least one edge in the matching $e\in M$ that has it as weight, i.e. $w(e)=l$.

> ***(All Weights Perfect Matching Problem)*** Given a weighted graph $G=(V,E,w)$,  does it admit an all weights perfect matching?

Of course, if some edge weight has only one representative in the graph $G$, it must be included in an AWPM. Hence we may assume at least two representatives per edge weight. Once there are at least two representatives for edge weights, things seem to get harder: how do we know which one to choose? The immediate followup question will be the essence of this post:

***How many representatives per weight does it take for the problem to become hard? 2? 3?***

In this post, I present two results:
1. *3-AWPM is NP-complete.* That is, the AWPM problem where each edge weight has at most 3 representatives, is NP-complete. This improvement is twofold over the last post, which showed that the **regular** AWPM problem is not in P.
2. *2-AWPM is in P.*

This places the AWPM problem among many other NP-complete problems, in which their "2-variant" is easy, whereas their "3-variant" is hard, like graph coloring, SAT, and more.

The NP-completeness part of this post is covered briefly, as it modifies the reduction given in [the previous post](https://deamir.github.io/posts/uncharted-4/). I refer you there for clarifications, intuitions and more details about the AWPM problem.

## 3-AWPM is NP-complete
Recall the 3-AWPM problem:
> (***3-AWPM Problem***) Given a weighted graph $G=(V,E,w)$, such that if $c\in w(E)$ then $\| \{ e\in E:w(e)=c\}\|\le 3$, does it admit an all weights perfect matching?

We briefly show a modified version of the reduction given at the previous post, that reduces 3-SAT to 3-AWPM.

Let $\psi = C_1\vee ...\vee C_k$ be a 3-SAT instance over the variables $x_1,...,x_n$. The 3-AWPM instance for $\psi$ is made up of variable gadgets and clause gadgets, and their interconnections.

The variable gadgets are the same as those in the previous post:
![iso_graphs](/assets/img/uncharted/variable-gadget.png){:width="550"}
 *The variable gadget for $x_i$ that has $\max (N(x_i),N(\neg x_i))=2$, for $N(y)$ number of appearances of $y$ in $\psi$*

If $x_i$ or $\neg x_i$ appears more times, make the loop bigger and add corresponding node-value pairs to the distribution section.

The weight values are distinct throughout the variable gadgets. The selection of which node to pair with the variable node (the one labeled $x_i$) dictates the truth value assignment, and dictates which pairs of variable nodes are forcefully matched. Surely, each weight has exactly two representatives.

We assume $\psi$ is of the form $\psi =\psi '\wedge \psi'$ for some 3-SAT formula $\psi '$. If it's not we continue with $\psi \wedge \psi$. So we may assume the existence of *twin clauses*, and specifically that the formula has the form $\psi=(C_1\wedge C_1')\wedge (C_2\wedge C_2')\wedge...\wedge (C_{k}\wedge C_{k}')$ where $C_i=C_i'$.

Now, we create a clause gadget for each $C_i$ and $C_i'$. That is, in total $2k$ clause gadgets.  The gadgets look like this:

![iso_graphs](/assets/img/finegrained-uncharted/clause-gadget.png)
*Clause gadgets for $C_i=C_i'=(x_1\wedge \neg x_2\wedge x_1)$*

Each gadget is made of 3 literal nodes which are labeled with the corresponding label. The nodes below the dotted blue line are not new nodes - these are value nodes from the variable gadgets that correspond to the literal nodes. Each literal node is connected to a respective value node from a variable gadget, as well as to "helper nodes" (the $h_i$s), one per literal node. Corresponding helper nodes from twin clause gadgets are connected with the same weight as that of the edge connecting them to their literal nodes. Each edge weight introduced by the clause gadgets has exactly 3 representatives.

Thus the graph is a 3-AWPM instance.

Why does this work? The argument that if the graph admits an AWPM then $\psi$ is satisfiable is equivalent to the one given in the previous post. We look at the truth value as told by the matchings of the variable gadgets and this way craft the truth value assignment to the variables. For each clause gadget, an AWPM must contain at least one edge connecting a literal node and a value node (an edge that crosses the dotted line), thus forcing a certain matching on the indicator node of that literal's variable. But that assignment satisfies the literal by construction and thus the clause.

It's the other direction that deserves a new treatment. Assume that $\psi$ is satisfiable, and we show that the graph admits an AWPM. We match the variable gadgets according to the satisfying assignment. Then, for each literal node in a clause gadget, if we can match it with its value node - we do so. (This happens when the helper's literal node is assigned a T truth value.)

Now we need to match the helpers and the literal nodes that haven't yet been matched. If a literal node hasn't been matched, so does its brother in its twin clause gadget. (Because they have been assigned the same truth value.) We match them both to their respective helpers. Now all of the literal nodes have been matched.

If there are helper nodes that haven't been matched, and because we matched those in pairs, we can match such helper nodes to their respective brother in its twin clause gadget.

We have a perfect matching, we show that it's all-weights. All of the weights in the variable gadgets are included. Because the assignment is satisfying, in each clause gadget, at least one literal to value node edge is included. Also, all weights involving helper nodes are included - either by adding edges between literal nodes and their helpers, or between helper nodes of twin clause gadgets.
## 2-AWPM is in P
The 2-AWPM problem is as follows:
> (***2-AWPM Problem***) Given a weighted graph $G=(V,E,w)$, such that if $c\in w(E)$ then $\|\{ e\in E:w(e)=c\}\|\le 2$, does it admit an all weight perfect matching?

We can assume that each weight has exactly two representatives, as described in the beginning of the post.

> (***2-AWPM Problem***) Given a weighted graph $G=(V,E,w)$, such that if $c\in w(E)$ then $\|\{ e\in E:w(e)=c\}\| = 2$, does it admit an all weight perfect matching?

Now, let's say that some weight has two edge representatives $a$ and $b$. If $a$ isn't in the all weights perfect matching, then $b$ must be. This is a similar structure to 2-SAT clauses: given a clause $(a\vee b)$, if $a=F$ then we must have $b=T$. Let's try to craft a 2-SAT formula that solves the 2-AWPM problem, i.e. reduce 2-AWPM to 2-SAT. As 2-SAT is in P, so will 2-AWPM be.

First some notation: $n=\|V\|$ number of vertices, $k=\|w(E)\|$ number of weights in the graph. Each weight has two representatives, hence $\|E\|=2k$. For each weight $c_i$ denote by $a_i,b_i\in E$ its two representatives.

Let's create the formula: $\psi = \varphi _1 \wedge \varphi _2 \wedge \varphi _3$, and it has one variable per edge in $E$. A variable is assigned the truth value T iff it's included in the all weights perfect matching. We show how to create $\varphi_i$s to enforce that an assignment is satisfying iff it yields an all weight perfect matching. For $\psi$ to be a 2-SAT formula, each $\varphi_i$ will be one, too.

**The first part $\varphi_1$ forces the selection to be a *matching*.** For that to happen, the selected edges need to be disjoint. For each edge $e\in E$ define $N(e)$ to be the set of edges that are incident to $e$, i.e. those that share a vertex with $e$. Then,

$$
\varphi _1 = \bigwedge _{e\in E}\bigwedge _{e\ne m\in N(e)}
(\neg e\vee \neg m)
$$

For each edge $e$, we force that one cannot select both $e$ and an incident edge to $e$.

**The second part $\varphi$ forces the selection to be *all-weights***, by forcing the selection of at least one representative for each of the $k$ weights in the graph.

$$
\varphi _2 = \bigwedge _{i=1}^k(a_i\vee b_i)
$$

**The third part $\varphi _3$ forces the selection to be a *perfect-matching*.** Or more precisely, to be an edge cover. To do that, we want that for each node, at least one edge adjacent to it is selected. Let $M (v)$ be the set of edges adjacent to a node $v$. Then,

$$
\varphi _3=\bigwedge _{v\in V}\bigvee _{e\in M(v)} e
$$

There is seemingly only one problem: $M(v)$ could contain more than 2 edges. Or could it?

Well, $\|M(v)\|=d(v)$ where $d(v)$ is the degree of $v$. We prove $d(v)=2$ for all nodes $v$. We could assume $d(v)\ge 2$, since if $d(v)=0$ then no perfect matching exists in the graph, let alone an all-weights one; and if $d(v)=1$ then $v$ must be matched using that edge.

Moreover, $\sum _{v\in V} d(v)/2=\|E\|=2k$, where $k$ is the number of distinct weight values in the graph. Surely if $k>n/2$ no AWPM exists, so we may assume $k\le n/2$, hence $\|E\|\le n$. As $d(v)\ge 2$, we have $\|E\|=\sum _v d(v)/2\ge n$.

Then, $\|E\|=n$, making $\sum _{v\in V} d(v)/2=\|E\|=n$ producing the following average degree:

$$
\sum _{v\in V} d(v)/n=2
$$

Because the average of the degrees is 2, and the degree of each node is at least 2, we get $d(v)=2$ for all $v\in V$, as needed.
